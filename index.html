													example, two different football matches), you can unite them in “Express”. To win an express
													bet it is necessary for you to not have any failed predictions (losses) on any of the
													outcomes which are included in the Express. Loss on one of the outcomes of an express bet
													means loss throughout the entire bet. Winnings of the express bets is equal the product of
													the bet amount at the coefficients of played outcomes included in the express (if on one of
													the bets included in the express occurs a return, then the coefficient on it equals to 1).
												</p>
												<p><span class="italic">“System”</span> – a set of “express bets” of a particular set of
													events. Each combination of the system is calculated as a separate express bet. To win in
													the system it is sufficient that the indicated number of predictions of the total number be
													correct (it is defined by name, that is, for example, in the system “3 of 4″ it is necessary
													that 3 of the 4 predictions prove correct, for “5 of 7″ it is necessary properly to predict
													the outcome of the five events of 7 options, etc.). It must be taken into account that
													because of the fact that only a part of the total bet amount is specified on each of the
													express of the system bet (proportional to the number of options) then the winnings by such
													a system bet will be less than the possible general winnings by the express bet. In some
													cases, when not all outcomes are predicted, the amount of winnings may be less than the
													amount of the bet, but in contrast to express bets, a part of the amount will be offset on
													account of correctly predicted outcomes.</p>
												<p><span class="italic">“Chain”</span> – bet which is a combination of “single” bets including
													events independent from each other. The sum of single bet of chain ‘s each event is equal to
													the sum of chain. The player is given a chance to determine independently the order of the
													bets included in the chain and stake only on the first event of the chain. Thus, the concept
													of “chain account” is imported. After the tournament of each single bet included in the
													chain the sum of that account is calculated. Initially it is equal to the sum of the first
													bet.</p>
												<p>If the sum on the chain account is less than its initial sum, the chain’s next event’s
													single bet is calculated by the account balance.</p>
												<p>The procedure of chain’s calculation depends on the order of bets mentioned in the given
													ticket but not on time.</p>
												<p>The sum which remains on the account after calculation of all bets in the chain is a
													subject to payment.</p>
												<p>If the sum on the chain account reaches zero – the chain breaks and is considered to be
													lost.</p>
												<p><span class="italic">“Handicap”</span> – the advantage or the leeway of the entrant of
													competition, expressed in goals (points/) sets, etc., which is provided by the bookmaker
													office to the entrant with bets on it. The result of the event subject to the handicap is
													determined in this way: the handicap given to the entrant is added to the corresponding
													result shown by the entrant in the competition. If the results thus obtained are in favor of
													the elected entrant, he is considered as a winner, and the bets on his win subject to the
													handicap win. Payments are carried out with the coefficient of winnings indicated in the
													description of bets. If the result is in favor of the opponent – the bets are lost. If the
													result subject to the handicap is a draw, then the coefficient of winnings under such a
													result will be equal to 1 (return of the bet);</p>
												<p>For example:</p>
												<p>Team 1 Team 2 Handicap 1 Coef. 1 Handicap 2 Coef.2</p>
												<p>Inter Cagliari -1.5 2.25 +1.5 1.9</p>
												<p>Suppose you want to bet upon the win of Cagliari subject to handicap. The handicap betting
													on Cagliari (Handicap 2) is equal to “+1.5″. To win with the bet on the handicap “+1.5″ it
													is necessary that Cagliari will not lose by more than 1 goal, as handicap +1.5 will be added
													to goals from Cagliari. Let us analyze all the options:</p>
												<p>* A) Cagliari won or the teams drew or Cagliari lost by the difference of 1 goal. For
													example, the final score is 2-1. Taking into account the handicap (+1.5) the result 2:2.5 in
													favor of Cagliari (the handicap of Inter when determining the result on the rates at
													Cagliari is not taken into account). The bets win.</p>
												<p>* B) Cagliari lost by more than 1 goal difference. For example, the final score is 2-0.
													Taking into account the handicap (+1.5) the result is 2:1.5 in favor of Inter. In this case,
													the rates on winning of Cagliari taking into account the handicap (+1.5) lose.</p>
												<p>Similarly, the following variants are possible when betting on a win for Inter taking into
													account the handicap “-1.5″:</p>
												<p>* a) Inter won having the advantage of two or more goals. For example, the final score is
													3-0. Taking into account the handicap (- 1.5) the result is 1.5:0 in favor of Inter. The
													bets win.</p>
												<p>* b) Inter won having the advantage of 1 goal, teams drew or Cagliari won. For example, the
													final score is 2-1. Taking into account the handicap -1.5, the result of the bets on Inter
													at handicap (-1.5) gives 0.5:1, in favor of Cagliari. In this case, the bets on Inter with
													the handicap -1.5 lose.</p>
												<p>Double bet of handicap is offered (Asian handicap). Bet on victory or total taking into
													account the handicap, which is the multiple of 0.25 (but not of 0.5). Such bets are
													calculated as 2 bets with the half of sum: with the same odd and “common handicaps” and
													“common totals” multiple of 0.5’s near- by common value. In case when the Asian handicap is
													included in parlay or system, it is calculated with that odd which would be in case of
													single bet. In case of winning of two common bets, the bet’s odd “O” is taken into account
													in the calculations. If one common bet is won and the other is a subject to refund, during
													the calculation is taken the odd (“O” +1)/2. If both common bets are lost, the whole bet
													considered lost.</p>

												<p><span class="italic">“Total”</span> – the number of goals, pucks, points or the games,
													scored (thrown, gained or played) by an entrant or entrants of events.</p>
												<p>For example:</p>
												<p>Suppose the total of the Football game is set (the amount of goals scored) equal to “4″,
													and a wagering is offered on the total at two outcomes: more or less of the given total.</p>
												<p>If the match is scored with a total of less than 4 goals (0-0, 1-0, 0-1, 1-1, etc.), bets
													lower than “4″ win.</p>
												<p>If the match is scored with a total of more than 4 goals (4-1, 4-2, 3-2, etc.), bets lower
													than “4″ lose and bets more than “4″ win.</p>
												<p>If the match is scored with a total of exactly 4 goals (3-1, 4-0, 2-2, 1-3, 0-4), all bets
													on more than “4″ and less than “4″ will be refunded.</p>

												example, errors in the coefficients indicated in teams incorrectly, incorrectly indicated
												events, etc.), or declare invalid the corresponding bets even after completion of the event.
												In the cases of correcting obvious errors bets are returned. The most common types of
												technical errors are the following:</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Errors of input of coefficients – when the coefficient (or the setting of the handicap/total,
												etc.) is displayed without a separator (dot) or with any additional number.
												Example: instead of the coefficient 1.8, 18 is displayed, instead of 2, 23 is displayed,
												instead of 3, 30 is displayed etc.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>“Mirror Errors” – when the coefficients for players are displayed in a diametrically opposite
												manner. In this case, the favorite of the game (including current favorite of live event) is
												displayed by a coefficient exceeding the coefficient of the outsider of the given event.
												Example: Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. Instead of 1.2 and 4, 4and
												1.2 is displayed.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<div>
												<p>Writing errors – if all the coefficients are indicated correctly, however, teams are
													written in an incorrect order (usually occurs for events taking place on a neutral field).
													Meaning for the previous example: record: Basketball. Unicaja-Barcelona. The winner of the
													match. 1.2 and 4 instead of Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. 1,2 and
													4</p>
												<p>Clear indicators of obvious errors are: very large difference in the coefficients of
													PowerPlay and other bookmakers, the coefficients that are nearly impossible to give in the
													current situation of the match.</p>
												<p>The right to determine whether or not an obvious or a technical error was made in any case

										</li>
										<li>
											<p>PowerPlay reserves the right to cancel the bets even after the end of the event if these bets

										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In cases when due to technical reasons the User’s bets were not provided with the necessary

												case of discrepancy of results from different sources of information, as well as in the case
												of their obvious mistakes the final decision to determine the results belongs to PowerPlay.
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>All inquiries of Account Holders regarding to the correctness of the results of PowerPlay

												regulatory bodies for these championships). Information from other sources cannot be
												considered a basis for the reviewing/reappraisal of bets.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Live event bet results are calculated based on what is known immediately after the end of the
												event/competition. All following changes (for example, changes by decision of a jury after the
												game) are not taken into account while deciding the bets. PowerPlay itself calculates these
												bets based on its statistical data about the actual course of the game. If not otherwise
												indicated, all bets on non- participating athletes in the competition will be void.</p>

										<li>
											<p>In cases when the PowerPlay’s statistics (based on TV coverage) are different from the

												was suspended, later is confirmed as final.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
